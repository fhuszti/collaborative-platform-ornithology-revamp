Collaborative platform for a research program on birds
===

French nonprofit organization Nos Amis les Oiseaux (fictive) is conducting a research program on where different species of birds currently live, as part of a larger study on biodiversity.
To that effect, they wanted to create an online collaborative platform so people could help them locate birds everywhere.

This is a project we did as a group (1 designer, 1 web marketing specialist, 3 devs) for our respective degrees.
As with all other school projects on this GitHub, it was done following requests from a fictive client.
We're mainly using Symfony3 and Doctrine, with jQuery for the front-end.
