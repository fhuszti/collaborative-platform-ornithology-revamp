(REVAMP) Collaborative platform for a research program on birds
===

French nonprofit organization Nos Amis les Oiseaux (fictive) is conducting a research program on where different species of birds currently live, as part of a larger study on biodiversity.
To that effect, they wanted to create an online collaborative platform so people could help them locate birds everywhere.

This is the revamp of a project we initally did as a group (1 designer, 1 web marketing specialist, 3 devs) for our respective degrees. I wasn't happy with the end result of the initial group project, so here's my solo revamp.
You can find the initial group project among my repositories with the same name, minus the "-revamp".

As with all other school projects on this GitHub, it was done following requests from a fictive client.
This project is mainly using Symfony3 and Doctrine, with jQuery for the front-end.
